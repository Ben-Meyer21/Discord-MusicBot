## ‚ú®Latest Updates‚ú®

> We are graciously waiting for Discord.js to update to v13 (as a stable version) so we can start updating the bot again. We know the bot has some bugs at the moment. 
>
> We can't fix all of them right now. Please check out the latest list of updates, improvements, and fixes to be made in Version 5 in the Discussions section or by clicking [here](https://github.com/Ben-Meyer21/Discord-MusicBot/discussions/236)

When you decide that you want to host this bot yourself, please do not expect this to work on the first try unless you know what you're doing. You need to know how to use the Discord Developer Portal as well as adding redirect_uri links to make your dashboard work properly. We try to help as best as we can, but please don't expect us to do it for you because are things that are required when using this bot.



## üìù [Support Server](Coming Soon!)

Do you have any issues with the bot? Head to our [Discord Server](Coming Soon!) where we can help you faster than creating a GitHub issue. If you have a major bug to report, it would be best to create an [issue here](https://github.com/Ben-Meyer21/Discord-MusicBot/Discord-MusicBot/issues).
